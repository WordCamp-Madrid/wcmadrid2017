=== WCLAX2014 ===

This is the theme for the WordCamp Los Angeles 2014 site. We're using the WordCamp Base Redux theme to get started. All changes should be made in the /sass/ directory, which will be output to custom.css, and then copied to Jetpack’s Custom CSS on the live site when we’re ready to launch.

... I'll finish the readme later.
